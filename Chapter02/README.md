# Chapter 02 - Generating drum sequences with DrumsRNN

In this chapter, you’ll learn what many consider the foundation of music: percussion. We’ll show the importance of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. You’ll then learn how to use an existing Magenta model called “Drums RNN”, by calling it on the command line and also directly in Python, to generate drum sequences. We’ll introduce the different model parameters, including the model’s MIDI encoding, and show how to interpret the output of the model.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:

- Represent internal state with a Recurrent Neural Network
- Use Drums RNN on the command line
- Use Drums RNN in Python
- Create a music generation application

## Code

### [Example 1](01.py) or [notebook](notebook.ipynb)

This example shows a basic Drums RNN generation with a hard coded primer.

### [Example 2](02.py)

This example shows a basic Drums RNN generation with synthesizer playback.

### [Example 3](03.py)

This example shows a basic Drums RNN generation with a looping synthesizer playback.
